# Comments to Evaluators:

This program demonstrates all the necessary functionality of a database. It connects to the SQL database 
using the user secrets and retreives the data from the tables such as high scores, scores, times survived.
It also contains the helper method for creating six tables and inserting data into them.

Both of us are using MacOS; thus, our code only runs when all the '/n''/r' are '\n''\r', otherwise it will break 
our code. 

# Assignments Specific Topics:

SQL, SSMS, Database, Tables, User Secrets.

# References:

    1. Code from Lab14

# Time Expenditures:

    Total Predicted Hours:       2           Total Actual Hours:           2

    All the work were done through pair programming, thus the time expenditures for each partner
    are the same.

# Partnerships:

All the work were done through pair programming (side by side coding).

# Testing:

We tested the DataBase programm by connecting our SQL server, opening the browser and trying to 
connect to our web server. Check to see if the tables are correctly created and data are correctly 
displayed and inserted.

# Branching:

We did all work for this project in the main branch.
