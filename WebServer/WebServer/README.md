# Comments to Evaluators:

 This class demonstrates all the necessary functionality of a web server. Upon start, it waits for 
 the browser to connect to port 11001. Then it parses the HTTP request and handles the GET requests.

# Assignments Specific Topics:

SQL, SSMS, Database, Tables, User Secrets, HTTP, HTML, CSS.

# References:

    1. HTTP Responses: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_responses.htm 
    2. HTML5: https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/
    3. CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp

# Time Expenditures:

    Total Predicted Hours:       12          Total Actual Hours:           12

    All the work were done through pair programming, thus the time expenditures for each partner
    are the same.

# Partnerships:

All the work were done through pair programming (side by side coding).

# Testing:

We tested the WebServer programm by connecting to our SQL server, opening the browser and trying to 
connect. We entered different GET requests to check if the web pages and data are displayed correctly. 
We also checked our database to see if the tables are successfully generated and data are inserted. 

# Branching:

We did all work for this project in the main branch.
