# Overview of the WebServer


The Communications class was copied from our previous assignment (A8), which is also our original code.

The detailed functionalities and information of each project can be found in the project level READMEs.

Note: 
Both of us are using MacOS; thus, we changed our all the '\r\n' to '\r', otherwise it will break 
our code. For our program to run on other machines, you will have to change all the '\r' to '\r\n' 
accordingly.

# Time Expenditures:

    Total Predicted Hours:          16           Total Actual Hours:         15
    Auroroa Total Predicted Hours:  16           Total Actual Hours:         15
    Sasha Total Predicted Hours:    16           Total Actual Hours:         15

    Time spent effectively: ~11 hours            Time spent debugging: ~2 hours
    Time spent learning tools and techniques: ~2 hours

    All the work were done through side by side pair programming, thus the time expenditures
    for each person are the same.

# Partnership

All the work were done through side by side pair programming, we constantly switched positions
as driver/navigator, we communicated a lot to make sure that each of us were on the same track.
Details for pair programming practice for each project can be found in the project level READMEs.


# Branching

All the work were done through the main branch. Since the partners worked side by side on the
whole project.


# Testing

For testing, we opened the SQL server and ran the webserver to open the browser. We tested the simple 
functionalities such as opening localhost:11001, sending random request see if the PageNotFound page 
was returned or not. Accessing highscores page, scores of specific players, and our fancy page to 
test if the required tables were displayed correctly and information was showing up successfully or not.

The details of testing for each project can be found in the project level READMEs.
